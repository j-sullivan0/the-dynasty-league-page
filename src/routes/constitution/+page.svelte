    <h4 bind:this={oneTwoThree}>1.2.3 Veto/Trade Process</h4>
    <div class="subBlock">
        <p>A total of 5 veto votes are required to veto a trade. Vetoes are only appropriate in instances of collusion or an egregious mismatch of value (i.e. CMC for a 3rd string player). Not liking a trade does not warrant a veto.</p>

    <h3 bind:this={twoThree}>2.3 Draft Day Trades</h3>

    <h2 class="sectionHeading" bind:this={six}>Section 6 Replacing Managers</h2>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sixOne}>6.1 Removing Managers</h3>
    <p>Short of continuously failing to set a valid lineup, confirmed collusion, or failure to pay league dues, no manager can be removed against their will.

    <h3 bind:this={sixTwo}>6.2 Replacing Managers</h3>
    <p>When a manager needs to be replaced, the commissioners will try to find a suitable candidate with some connection to at least a portion of the existing managers.

    <h3 bind:this={sixThree}>6.3 Replacement Incentive</h3>
    <p>In the event that a manager chooses to quit the league or is removed by a commissioner, an incoming manager is offered a 50% reductioon on their first year buy-in.</p>

    <h3 bind:this={sevenOne}>7.1 League Dues</h3>
    <p>League dues are set at {dues}$. Dues are collected via multiple payment methods (mainly Venmo or equivalent) and collection will be sent out no later than the first of September. All managers must be fully paid up before the start of regular season. Failure to make payment is grounds for removal, at the League's discretion</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenTwo}>7.2 Payout</h3>
    <p>League payout is winner-takes-all. The Champion will receive 100% of the payout.</p>
    
    <p>If new managers come into the league and are offered a 50% discount, the payout will be reduced by this difference.</p>
    
    <h3 bind:this={sevenThree}>7.3 Raising Dues</h3>
    <p>A â…” majority vote is required in order to raise league dues. In the event that a manager is no longer financially comfortable with the buyin, finding a co-manager to split the cost is reccomended.</p>
